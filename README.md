# Spot Tools
A place for spot tools

```bash
python3 -m venv spot_tools_env
pip install -e .
```
To run the linter on everything:
```
pre-commit run --all-files
```


# Examples

You can find an example of the ROS-free spot executor in
`examples/test_spot_executor.py`. You should be able to run this and see
a little plot of the agent moving along a path. Run it with `python -i` so
that the plot stays at the end. If it crashes with an inscrutable error,
you may need to `pip install opencv-python-headless` because of a conflict
between opencv's QT version and matplotlib's QT version.


# Testing Mid-Level Planner in Simulation

You can find the implemented mid-level planner in `robot_executor_interface/src/robot_executor_interface/mid_level_planner.py`.

## Setup and Testing Instructions

The mid-level planner can be tested using the DCIST launch system with fake publishers to simulate robot behavior and occupancy data.

### 1. Launch the DCIST System

First, launch the complete DCIST system in simulation mode:

```bash
ADT4_SIM_TIME=false tmuxp load dcist_launch_system/tmux/autogenerated/spot_prior_dsg-spot_prior_dsg.yaml
```

This will start all the necessary nodes including the spot executor and planning systems.

### 2. Start the Fake Occupancy Publisher

In a separate terminal, launch the fake occupancy publisher to provide simulated occupancy grid data:

```bash
ros2 run spot_tools_ros fake_occupancy_publisher
```

This publishes a test occupancy grid that the mid-level planner uses for obstacle avoidance and path planning.

### 3. Send Path Commands

In another terminal, use the fake path publisher to send waypoint commands to the planner:

```bash
ros2 run spot_tools_ros fake_path_publisher <x> <y>
```

Where `<x>` and `<y>` are the desired target coordinates. For example:
```bash
ros2 run spot_tools_ros fake_path_publisher -6 1
```

### 4. Visualization in RViz

Launch RViz to visualize the planning behavior and monitor the following key topics:

1. **High-level Path**: `/hamilton/omniplanner_node/compiled_plan_viz_out`
   - Shows the simulated high-level path from the omniplanner

2. **Mid-Level Planner Output**: `/hamilton/spot_executor_node/mlp_path_publisher`
   - Displays the locally planned path from the mid-level planner
   - This path incorporates obstacle avoidance and local optimization

3. **Occupancy Grid**: `/hamilton/hydra/tsdf/occupancy`
   - Shows the TSDF occupancy map used for planning
   - Visualizes obstacles and free space

### Expected Behavior

The mid-level planner should:
- Receive high-level waypoints from the fake path publisher
- Process the occupancy grid from the fake occupancy publisher
- Generate locally optimal paths that avoid obstacles
- Publish the resulting path for execution by the robot controller

This testing setup allows you to validate the mid-level planner's obstacle avoidance, path smoothing, and local optimization capabilities in a controlled simulation environment.
